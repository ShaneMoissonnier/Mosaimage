**Mosaimage** is a fun project that generates an image using thousands of other tiny images. It's implemented in Rust and serves as a personal learning project to improve my knowledge of the language. The project is purely for fun and experimental purposes.

## How does it works?

**Mosaimage** takes an input image and generates a mosaic version of it by replacing each pixel of the original image with a small image tile from a collection of images. These image tiles can be anything - from random images to specific themed images.

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Image Processing**: The original input image is loaded and processed to prepare it for the mosaic creation.
2. **Tile Selection**: A collection of small image tiles is selected to create the mosaic. These tiles can be sourced from a predefined set or generated dynamically.
3. **Mosaic Generation**: Each pixel of the input image is analyzed, and the corresponding tile is selected from the collection based on color similarity.
4. **Mosaic Assembly**: The selected tiles are placed together to form the final mosaic image.

## Usage

To use **Mosaimage**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ShaneMoissonnier/Mosaimage.git
   ```

2. Build the project using Rust's package manager, Cargo:

   ```
   cd mosaimage
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Prepare your input image and the collection of image tiles. Place them in the appropriate directories.

4. Run the program:

   ```
   cargo run --release -- -i /path/to/input/image.png -o /path/to/output/image.png -s /path/to/collection/of/images/
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/input/image.png` with the path to your desired input image, `/path/to/output/image.png` with the path of the result image and `/path/to/collection/of/images/` with the path of the folder containing the image collection to be used for the mosaic.

## Future Development

While Mosaimage is primarily a personal learning project, I may continue to work on it in the future. Possible areas for improvement and expansion include:

- **Refactoring**: The codebase may undergo refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and adhere to best practices.
- **Optimization**: The performance of the mosaic generation algorithm could be optimized to handle larger images or improve efficiency.
- **User Interface**: Adding a user-friendly interface, such as a web-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI), could make the project more accessible and enjoyable to use.
- **Additional Features**: I may explore adding additional features, such as image manipulation options, customization settings, or advanced mosaic generation algorithms.
